    //Update: I've removed this for now. There's not much point storing content IDs in the user object as it gets fetched from the DB at the start
    // and never used again, and just creates extra work when adding/deleting goals and other content. For now we can just get the content IDs
    // straight from the DB and then load the content from the DB and place it in arrays.
    
    /// User's weekly goals, stored by ID.
    //Goals will be stored as IDs under users as there's not much point nesting it in user objects, we only need to know what goals the user owns.
    //When fetched from the database the goals will already be in an array, and the goal VCs will require them in an array for the table views to work.
    //Just saves a bit of effort having to arbitrarily store fetched goals in the user object then place them in a variable in the VCs.
    //var weeklyGoals: [String]
